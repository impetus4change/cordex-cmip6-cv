# I4C Controlled Vocabulary (CV) for use in archiving RCM-emulator results

This is a fork of the [CORDEX-CMIP6 CV](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/cordex-cmip6-cv) to develop a new CV for RCM-emulator output data to be used in Impetus4Change.

You can check differences with the base CORDEX-CMIP6 CV for dynamical downscaling [here](https://github.com/impetus4change/cordex-cmip6-cv/compare/main..emulators).
