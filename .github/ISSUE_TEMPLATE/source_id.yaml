      label: label
      description: >
        A short acronym that uniquely identifies your model and distinguishes
        it from other versions used in CORDEX-CMIP6.
        Dots and spaces are allowed to improve legibility and reflect actual
        model names.
      placeholder: ex. `REMO2020` or `WRF v4.4.2-Q`
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: input
    id: label_extended
    attributes:
      label: label_extended
      description: >
        A longer description of the model name, possibly including the acronym expanded.
      placeholder: ex. `Weather Research and Forecasting model version 4.4.2, CORDEX WRF Community configuration Q`
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: input
    id: source_id
    attributes:
      label: source_id
      description: >
        An identifier corresponding to `label` but with forbidden
        characters either removed or replaced by a hyphen (`-`).
        The `source_id` will appear in the ESGF search interface and in filenames
        and subdirectory names.
        Restrict characters used in source_id to letters, numbers and hyphens
        (e.g. NO dots, spaces or underscores are allowed).
        There is a limitation of 25 characters for this field.
      placeholder: ex. `REMO2020` or `WRF442Q`

        source type should be added, please, open first an issue requesting to update

      label: release_year
      description: >
        Release year of the model. Provide when relevant.
        This should be the year your model was first used in a scientific study.
        This year should reflect the "generation" of models rather than
        distinguishing between closely-related versions.

        responsible for one or more CORDEX-CMIP6 simulations with this
        specific `source_id`. Additional institutions can be added to the list
        as needed, but only institutions registered may be included.

        but it should be updated as detailed information of the exact model
        version registered is published.
